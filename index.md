{: .warning }
> This website documents the features of the current `main` branch of the Just the Docs theme. See [the CHANGELOG]({% link CHANGELOG.md %}) for a list of releases, new features, and bug fixes.

Browse the docs to learn more about how to use this theme.

## Getting started

provides the simplest, quickest, and easiest way to create a new website that uses the Just the Docs theme. To get started with creating a site.

{: .note }
To use the theme, you do ***not*** need to clone or fork the [Just the Docs repo]! You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Just the Docs.

You can easily set the site created by the template to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [template README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach
- uses the github

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with the template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

{: .note }
See the theme [README][Just the Docs README] for how to use the theme as a gem without creating a new site.
