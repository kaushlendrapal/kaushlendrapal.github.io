## My Architecture Philosophy
Performed Job with a strong focus on designing scalable, modular, and maintainable app architectures across iOS and Android platforms. My work centers around building future-ready mobile solutions using modern paradigms that align with the evolving needs of fast-paced engineering teams and large-scale products.

ðŸ”¹ Architecture-First Mindset
I specialize in Single-Activity Architecture and Multi-Module Architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns, faster builds, and enhanced code reusability. My architectural approach is deeply influenced by Feature-First Development, which allows teams to iterate independently, ship faster, and scale confidently.

ðŸ”¹ Scalability with Clarity
For apps with complex data flows and team collaboration, I embrace Unidirectional Data Flow, helping reduce side effects and improve state management clarity. This is coupled with principles from Clean Architecture, SOLID design, and MVI/MVVM patterns, to enforce structure while keeping codebases testable and maintainable over time.

ðŸ”¹ Cross-Platform Balance
I bring architectural consistency across platforms, adapting patterns for SwiftUI/UIKit on iOS, and Jetpack/Kotlin on Android. Whether building a new app or refactoring legacy code, I ensure the same architectural principles apply, from the core to UI layer.

ðŸ”¹ Code Quality & Programming Philosophy
My development style emphasizes protocol-oriented and reactive programming, with a strong preference for Test-Driven Development (TDD). I believe great architecture empowers teamsâ€”not just the appâ€”and I focus on setting up systems that are easy to onboard, scale, and evolve.

ðŸ”¹ Team & Process Alignment
Beyond code, I lead architecture reviews, mentor devs, and integrate tooling (CI/CD, linters, SonarQube) to uphold standards. I strive to create an engineering culture where architecture is not a bottleneck but a catalyst for velocity and stability.

## Want To Automate App Delivery
Iâ€™ve built and maintained scalable CI/CD pipelines for iOS, Android, and Flutter applications, integrating tools and practices across modern delivery platforms to enable continuous integration, testing, and release automation.

iOS:
For iOS, I automate build workflows using Shell scripts, xcodebuild, and Fastlane actions. CI pipelines are deployed through:
GitHub Actions for modular workflows and parallel builds.
Xcode Cloud for seamless integration with Appleâ€™s ecosystem.
Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Bamboo pipelines with declarative YML jobs to execute linting (via SwiftLint), unit/UI tests, code signing, and .ipa packaging.
Final builds are distributed via TestFlight or App Store Connect, with automated changelogs and environment-based configuration.

Android:
For Android projects, I use Gradle tasks within:
GitHub Actions, Jenkins Pipelines, and GitLab CI/CD YML files for flavor-based builds, instrumentation tests, linting, and ProGuard configuration.
Build artifacts (.apk/.aab) are uploaded to Google Play Console via Fastlane.
Husky pre-commit hooks ensure static code analysis and formatting compliance.

Flutter:
Flutter workflows are unified across platforms using:
Custom shell scripts, flutter build, and Fastlane integrations.
CI/CD managed in GitHub Actions, GitLab .gitlab-ci.yml, and Jenkinsfile, automating build, test, linting (flutter analyze), and store deployment.

Pipeline Setup:
Jenkins: Custom pipelines via Jenkinsfile integrating xcodebuild, gradle, and flutter commands with SonarQube scan stages.
